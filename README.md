# Consumer Behaviour & RFM Analysis in Online Retail
Data-driven Analysis of Consumer Behaviour and RFM Segmentation in Online Retail

## Overview
This project applies **data analytics and customer intelligence techniques** to analyse consumer behaviour in online retail. It combines **sentiment analysis of customer reviews** with **RFM-based customer segmentation** to extract actionable insights on customer satisfaction, engagement, and value.

The project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis — from raw data preprocessing to insight-driven visualisation — using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Business Problem
Online retailers generate large volumes of customer reviews and transaction data, but deriving meaningful insights from this data is challenging. Businesses need to:
- Understand customer sentiment from unstructured text
- Identify high-value and at-risk customers
- Segment customers based on purchasing behaviour
- Support data-driven marketing and retention strategies

This project addresses these challenges using practical, industry-relevant analytics techniques.

## Datasets Used

### Amazon Shopping Reviews Dataset (2024)
- Source: Mendeley Data (Public Repository)
- Type: Customer reviews and ratings (textual + numerical)
- Usage: Sentiment analysis using VADER

### E-commerce Transaction Dataset (2024–2025)
- Source: Publicly available online retail dataset
- Type: Transaction-level order data
- Usage: RFM metric calculation and customer segmentation

**Dataset Note:**  
The full transaction dataset exceeds GitHub’s 25 MB file size limit.  
A representative sample has been uploaded for reference, while all analysis and visualisations were performed on the complete dataset locally.

## Methodology
1. Loaded and cleaned raw review and transaction datasets
2. Preprocessed text data and removed incomplete records
3. Applied VADER sentiment analysis to classify customer opinions
4. Calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics
5. Segmented customers based on behavioural patterns
6. Visualised insights using charts, scatter plots, and word clouds

All trends shown are **historical and illustrative**, not predictive.

---

## Key Insights
- Majority of customer reviews express **positive sentiment**, indicating overall satisfaction
- Strong alignment observed between textual sentiment and rating behaviour
- RFM analysis identified **high-value**, **regular**, and **at-risk** customer segments
- High-frequency customers contribute disproportionately to total revenue
- Visual analytics enable clear identification of priority customer groups
